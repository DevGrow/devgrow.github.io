</a></p>

  <li>Finds “mailto:” links and tacks on animated mailbox graphics!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The last plugin is probably my favorite of the bunch, as it makes corny any blog when viewed in Internet Explorer 6.  What better deterrent to using an outdated browser than every blog you view looking like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Geocities</a> site?</p>
