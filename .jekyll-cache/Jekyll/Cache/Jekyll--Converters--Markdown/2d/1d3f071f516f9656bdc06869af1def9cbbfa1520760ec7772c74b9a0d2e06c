I"z<p>Welcome to the all new <strong>DevGrow</strong>. What first started out as a experimental social network for entrepreneurs and investors and ended up as a blog for the same audience, we are back to focus on what we know best - the design, development and growth of your website. Whether itâ€™s a new blog about the iPad or the next Farmville, our goal is to help you better understand and appreciate the web by providing resources on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Graphic design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HTML and CSS tutorials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Web design and creative inspiration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Icon packs and other freebies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tips on freelancing and creative direction</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The goal will be to focus on quality rather than quantity, so expect to see a few good posts a week rather than a continuous barrage of sub-par material. I will try my best to maintain consistency, however I rely on constant feedback in the comments from you guys to keep the quality high. So bookmark the site, subscribe to the RSS feed and join me in this exploration of all things design and creativity.</p>
