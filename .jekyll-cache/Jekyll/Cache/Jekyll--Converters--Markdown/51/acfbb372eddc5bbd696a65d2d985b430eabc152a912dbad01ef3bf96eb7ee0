<h5 id="semrush"><a href="http://www.semrush.com/">SEMRush</a></h5>

<p>I‚Äôve been playing with this site for the past couple of days but I‚Äôm already a fan - you can test it out by going to their site and entering any domain name to find how that site ranks for many keywords.  It‚Äôs highly useful for finding relevant keywords to build on, however they limit the free results to the top 10 keywords.  Their premium plans start at $59/mo and allow up to 10,000 results per report, plus they give you API access, which is very cool.</p>
