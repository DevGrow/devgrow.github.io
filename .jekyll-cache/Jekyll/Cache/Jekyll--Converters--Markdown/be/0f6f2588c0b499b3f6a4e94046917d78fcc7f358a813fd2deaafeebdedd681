I"¿<p>While playing around with JQuery UIâ€™s slider widgets, I decided to throw together a quick freelance project estimator.  This is <strong>not based on science or statistics</strong>, so use it with your own judgement.  The â€˜Client Informationâ€™ bits shouldnâ€™t be taken too seriously either, I added that in to emphasize that the type of client can often dictate quotes too.  By the way, I apologize but the first two sliders can be a little fidgety, likely the result of my poor scripting.</p>
