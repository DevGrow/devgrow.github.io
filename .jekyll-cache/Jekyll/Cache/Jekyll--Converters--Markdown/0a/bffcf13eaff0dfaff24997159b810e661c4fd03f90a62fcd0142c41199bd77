I"€<p>If web design is art and art is interpretive, can there be such a thing as design etiquette?  While it‚Äôs true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, there are certain standards and conventions to follow when dealing with design, otherwise you may face a lot of difficulty with people accepting or understanding your work.  This concept of a design standards is especially vital if you‚Äôre a business attempting to sell a service or product - you need to engage your visitors and convert them into paying customers, and having a great design can help you do just that.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>When designing a website, it helps to set a goal for what you want to accomplish with it, as that can dictate what you should or shouldn‚Äôt do in terms of design.  If you‚Äôre a business, you should aim for professionalism and clear calls to action.  On the other hand, if you‚Äôre showcasing your portfolio, you have a lot more freedom in your design.  Either way, your website is essentially a digital representation of you (or your company), a professional and clean design can mean a lot!</p>

<h2 id="control-your-colors">Control Your Colors</h2>

<p>This is a relatively simple concept that many websites fail to understand.  If you choose to have color in your design (versus black and white), keep them limited, friendly and tame.  What do I mean by this?</p>

<h3 id="do-not-use-colors-that-are-too-bright-angry-or-blinding-ie"><em>DO NOT</em> use colors that are too bright, angry or blinding, ie:</h3>

<h2 id="prevent-information-overload">Prevent Information Overload</h2>

<p>Great design can be ruined by overwhelming the visitor with too much information.  Put yourself in the shoes of a random visitor who has somehow found his way to your site - he wants to know who you are and what you provide without having to sift through the rubble.  Writing good copy can and will increase your conversions, just remember to keep things concise and relevant to the visitors‚Äô needs.</p>

<h2 id="usability">Usability</h2>

<p>Last but not least, for the sake of your visitors, keep your site user friendly!  Things should work the way they‚Äôre supposed to and your visitors shouldn‚Äôt have to struggle to navigate your website.  Make calls to action sparingly but prominently, using buttons, videos or anything that will capture attention without creating confusion.  Little details can matter here, for instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have something shaped like a button, make sure it is clickable and acts like a button!</li>
  <li>Keep things obvious - if you want to embed a video, make it clear that what the visitor is seeing <em>is</em> in fact a video (video controls often help, as do a translucent ‚Äúplay‚Äù button)</li>
  <li>If you‚Äôre a business, let the visitor understand what you are immediately - they don‚Äôt want to spend more than 30 seconds figuring out what you offer</li>
  <li>Put your navigation at the top of the site and make it prominent/obvious</li>
  <li>On the subject of navigations, keep the links limited and broad, use sub-menus if you must</li>
  <li>Consider the manner in which a visitor, or a potential customer, would want to view your website and try to place your content in that order</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="do-not-make-your-visitor-wonder-what-it-is-you-offer-or-why-they-are-at-your-website"><em>DO NOT</em> make your visitor wonder what it is you offer or why they are at your website.</h3>

<h3 id="do-use-proper-calls-to-action-intelligent-content-placement-and-proper-navigation-menus"><em>DO</em> use proper calls to action, intelligent content placement and proper navigation menus.</h3>

<p>Make life easy for the visitor and encourage them to do whatever is that you want them to.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While the rules of web design are far from concrete, there are some standards and practices that will help you become a better designer and more importantly, help you better connect with your visitors.
