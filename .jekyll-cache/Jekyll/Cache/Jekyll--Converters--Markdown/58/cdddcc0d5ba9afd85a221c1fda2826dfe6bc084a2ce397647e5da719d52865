I"Â	<p>If youâ€™ve been to the site today then youâ€™ve probably noticed that it was down intermittently throughout the evening.  One of our articles was featured on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>â€™s Twitter stream (sweet!) and Iâ€™m sad to say the site crumbled under the traffic spike.  Iâ€™ve made a few changes that will hopefully make the site more resistant to bumps in traffic.</p>

<h4 id="the-original-setup">The Original Setup</h4>

<p>Iâ€™ve mentioned this before but the site is hosted on the smallest VPS available at Linode, which features 360MB of RAM and 200GB of bandwidth.  I used a fairly standard LAMP setup, with Apache2, MySQL and PHP with fastcgi.  I was also using W3 Total Cache, the supposed top dog of WordPress cache systems.  My server admin skills are still very raw (nearly nonexistent), so I skipped out on major fine-tuning of Apache and MySQL and left things as-is, for the most part.</p>

<p>For the most part, things seemed to be running fine.  Every time the site would get upwards of 200-300 concurrent users, however, CPU usage and IO rates would skyrocket, causing the entire VPS to lock up and require a restart.  I tried messing with the tuning a bit but ultimately I decided that if wanted traffic to increase over time, I needed to make the site resistant to the Digg/Reddit/HN/etc.-effect.</p>

<h4 id="enter-nginx">Enter nginx</h4>

<p>Iâ€™ve switched from Apache to Lightppd on another project and the changes were instantly noticeable.  The site was averaging several thousand pageviews a day and with Apache, my CPU usage on a 360MB slice would hover at around 70% and would crash the site during high usage.  Since switching to Lighttpd, the site rarely goes above 20% CPU usage.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about how amazing nginx is, so Iâ€™ve decided to take the plunge and test it out.  Overall it was a cinch to install and configure, with the rewrites being painless (compare to the nightmare that was Lighttpd config).  If it performs nearly as well as itâ€™s supposed to, I think Iâ€™m going to be sticking to this one for a while.</p>

<h4 id="sorry-for-the-downtime">Sorry for the Downtime</h4>

<p>The site was down several times throughout the evening and if you were trying to access it, I apologize.  If youâ€™re still getting errors, bear with me until theyâ€™re resolved.
