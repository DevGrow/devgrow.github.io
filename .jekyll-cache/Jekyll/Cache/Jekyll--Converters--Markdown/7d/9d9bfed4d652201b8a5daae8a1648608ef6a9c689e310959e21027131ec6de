I"<p>Iâ€™ve just spent the past couple of days rewriting a lot of the <a href="https://github.com/mdolon/jQuery-Mobile-PHP-MVC">jQuery Mobile PHP MVC Framework</a>.  A complete list of updates is available after the break, so check it out and let me know if you have any feedback!</p>

<h4 id="updates">Updates:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Overall code base simplified and cleaned up, unused functions removed</li>
  <li>Support for PHP PDO</li>
  <li>Now uses a simple SQLite database with a single table for the base application</li>
  <li>Now uses a smarter, more effective PHP router class (thanks to <a href="http://blog.sosedoff.com/2009/09/20/rails-like-php-url-router/">Dan Sosedoff</a>)</li>
  <li>All of the code is now thoroughly commented</li>
  <li>You no longer have to specify the base directory, it is automatically directed</li>
  <li>Fixed bug related to page redirections</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that caused buttons to show up improperly</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that prevented â€˜Backâ€™ button from appearing</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there is always room for improvement so any and all feedback is appreciated.  There are certainly a few bad programming practices, so if more experienced coders could help point them out I will gladly fix them up!</p>
