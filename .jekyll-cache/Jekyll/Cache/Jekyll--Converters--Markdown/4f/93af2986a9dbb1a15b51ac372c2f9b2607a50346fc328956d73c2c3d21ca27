I"Ÿ<p>This is the first of a series of tutorials aimed at teaching you how to create realistic interface elements that you can use on your websites or in mobile applications.  The buttons created in this article are simple and easy to customize, changing the value of a single layer effect can change the color of the entire button.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-prepare-the-canvas">Step 1 Prepare the Canvas</h3>

<p>Create a new Photoshop document about 600px wide and 300px high, that should give us plenty of space to work in.  Fill the background with a light grey color (I used #eeeeee) and apply the Noise filter (Filter -&gt; Noise -&gt; Add Noise) with the following settings:</p>

<h3 id="step-2-create-the-base-shape">Step 2 Create the Base Shape</h3>

<p>Create a white rounded rectangle (hot key: U) with a radius of 3px and with Anti-alias turned on.  I made mine 150px by 40px but any size will do.  Make sure the button itself is white (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#FFFFFF</code>) as that will help when it comes to applying effects in the next step.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-apply-layer-effects">Step 3 Apply Layer Effects</h3>

<p>This step is really where the button gets itâ€™s 3D feel from.  Weâ€™ll be applying a number of layer effects:</p>

<img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/color-overlay.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/gradient-overlay.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>To summarize, we are applying:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Drop Shadow</strong> - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#000000</code>, Normal blend mode, 15% Opacity, Angle: 120, Distance: 2, Spread: 0, Size: 2</li>
  <li><strong>Inner Shadow</strong> - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#FFFFFF</code>, Multiply blend mode, 30% Opacity, Angle: 120, Distance: 2, Spread: 0, Size: 2</li>
  <li><strong>Inner Glow</strong> - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#000000</code>, Normal blend mode, 40% Opacity, Choke: 100%, Size: 1</li>
  <li><strong>Bevel and Emboss</strong> - Style: Inner Bevel, Direction: Up, SIze: 2, Soften: 2, Angle: 120, Altitude: 30, Anti-aliased, Highlight Mode: Hard Mix, Highlight Color: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#FFFFFF</code>, Highlight Opacity: 50%, Shadow Mode: Multiply, Shadow Color: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#000000</code>, Shadow Opacity: 35%</li>
  <li><strong>Color Overlay</strong> - Mode: Linear Burn, Color: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#b6f27a</code> (you could use another light color instead)</li>
  <li><strong>Gradient Overlay</strong> - Blend mode: Luminosity, Opacity: 25%, Gradient: Black to white (left to right)</li>
</ol>

<p>The above settings should produce a 3D-looking button effect.  Applying both gradient and color overlays allows us to easily change the color of the button - simply change the color overlay until youâ€™re satisfied with the color of the button.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-add-text">Step 4 Add Text</h3>

<p>Depending on whether or not you chose a light or dark color overlay, your text will have to be either black or white.  For light backgrounds use black and for dark backgrounds, use black text color.  I used the <strong>Gotham Bold</strong> font with uppercase letters.  I cranked the layer fill opacity down to 75% and applied the <strong>Bevel and Emboss</strong> style with the following settings:

<h3 id="step-5-create-hover-and-active-states">Step 5 Create Hover and Active States</h3>

<p>To create the hover state, I simply change the <strong>Color Overlay</strong> value to something a little lighter and punchier - in this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#ccff84</code>.  As for the active state, I change a few settings on both the text and the button itself.</p>

<h5 id="active-button">Active Button:</h5>

<p>The button itself has the gradient and bevel reversed, a different color overlay and a inner shadow among other things.  The exact values are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Drop Shadow</strong> - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#FFFFFF</code>, 50% Opacity, Distance: 2, Size: 2</li>
  <li><strong>Inner Shadow</strong> - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#000000</code>, 30% Opacity, Angle: -60, Distance: 2, Size: 2</li>
  <li><strong>Inner Glow</strong> - Same as default and hover states</li>
  <li><strong>Bevel and Emboss</strong> - Change Direction from Up to Down, Change Highlight Opacity to 25%</li>
  <li><strong>Color Overlay</strong> - I set mine to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#7ab91f</code></li>
  <li><strong>Gradient Overlay</strong> - Reverse gradient and set to 45% Opacity</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the same settings in Photoshop:

<img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/active-gradient.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h5 id="active-text">Active Text:</h5>

<p>For the text, I changed the color to white (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#FFFFFF</code>) and lowered itâ€™s fill opacity to 85%.  I also moved the actual text down by a pixel, which gives it the feeling of being pressed.  Lastly, I applied a Bevel and Emboss layer effect with the following settings:</p>

<p><img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/active-text.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="final-results">Final Results</h3>

<p><img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/all-buttons.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, I also made some darker colored buttons.  For the text on those, I used the same settings as the Active state of the lighter buttons, with the only difference being the Fill Opacity was turned up to 90% instead of 85%.</p>
