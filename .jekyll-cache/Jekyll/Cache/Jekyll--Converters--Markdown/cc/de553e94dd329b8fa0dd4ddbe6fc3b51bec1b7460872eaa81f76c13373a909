I"L<p>Over the past six months, I’ve lived and breathed the startup life, working full-time as lead designer/frontend engineer for a pre-Series-A startup in Silicon Valley.  I’m back on the East Coast now tending to some family issues, but I wanted to take some time to reflect on what I’ve learned over the past few months.</p>
