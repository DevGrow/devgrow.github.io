I"Ž<p><strong>And weâ€™re back!</strong>  First off, apologies for the dry spell in new blog posts over the past 3 months - Iâ€™ve been incredibly busy with a new job, moving to the Bay area, family/personal issues and a buildup of client work (all at once!).  Thankfully things have settled down quite a bit and I should have some time each week to dedicate to DevGrow and my other pet projects.</p>
