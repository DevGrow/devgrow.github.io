  <strong>Note:</strong> I've released an update to this, check out the <a href="http://devgrow.com/updated-jquery-mobile-php-mvc-framework/">blog post</a> for more details!
</div>

<p>In my <a href="http://devgrow.com/mobile-web-dev-using-jquery-mobile/">Introduction to jQuery Mobile</a>, I mentioned that I had plans for a simple MVC framework using jQuery Mobile and that I would release it if there was enough interest (there was!).  While itâ€™s not completely finished yet, Iâ€™ve decided to release it in hopes that others find use in it and can perhaps even contribute towards itâ€™s development.</p>

<h2 id="preview-and-download">Preview and Download</h2>

<p>You can view the files or contribute at the <a href="https://github.com/mdolon/jQuery-Mobile-PHP-MVC">Github repository</a>.  The code is released under GPL so use it however youâ€™d like!</p>

<h3 id="current-features">Current Features</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Simple Database (MySQL) and Authentication Classes</li>
  <li>Custom routing for clean URLs</li>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

<p>Please read this part, as it is crucial to getting the application to work on your test machine.  You must manually edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.php</code> file with, at the least, your database information/credentials and the <strong>BASE_URL</strong> of the installation.  <strong>The app will not work without these two settings.</strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/lib/config.php</code>:</p>

<h3 id="work-in-progress">Work in Progress</h3>

<p>Please be aware that this code is still in development and is likely to have bugs that need fixing.  It is by all means beta-ware and I wouldnâ€™t recommend using it in a production environment as-is.  That said, it should still provide you with a solid base to build your mobile application from, so <a href="https://github.com/mdolon/jQuery-Mobile-PHP-MVC">download the files</a> and dig in!  If you are interested in contributing to the code, please get in touch via the <a href="http://devgrow.com/contact">contact page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mdolon">Github</a>.</p>
