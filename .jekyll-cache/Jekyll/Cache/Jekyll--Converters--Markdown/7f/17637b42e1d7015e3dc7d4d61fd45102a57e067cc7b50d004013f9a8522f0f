I"<p>I finally got around to redesigning my client invoice template and I’ve decided to share it with you guys.  It’s in PSD format and you’re free to use it for whatever you’d like!  Simply open the document in Photoshop, add new items, save it as a PDF and email it to your clients - a few quick steps to a professional invoice.</p>

<p>The following is a PSD organized into multiple layers and folders.  Use the invoice template however you’d like, feel free to change it and redistribute it as you see fit!</p>

<p>The invoice design itself takes a lot of influence from several web apps, including <a href="http://ballparkapp.com/">Ballpark</a>, <a href="http://freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks</a> and <a href="http://blinksale.com/">Blinksale</a>.  I personally don’t send that many of them so I haven’t signed up for their services, however if you work with a lot of clients on a monthly basis, be sure to check them out!</p>
