I"%<p>I’ve just finished an update to the Sharebar WordPress plugin that adds color selectors for the vertical widget, new <a href="http://www.sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a> buttons and a switch to the Facebook Like (from Facebook Share) button.  I had planned to have AJAX loading of buttons finished with this release however it’s proving to be a bit more difficult than I originally expected.</p>

<h3 id="12-change-log">1.2 Change Log:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added ability to change color of vertical widget from admin panel</li>
  <li>Added ShareThis buttons</li>
  <li>Changed Facebook Share to Facebook Likes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="to-do-list">To-do List:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AJAX loading of buttons</li>
  <li>Better browser compatibility (specifically Internet Explorer)</li>
  <li>More default buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>So it turns out AJAX loading isn’t as easy as I thought.  While several buttons work, many do not function properly when called from another page via jQuery’s GET function.  I ended up switching to the Facebook ‘Like’ button as the default over the Facebook ‘Share’ widget, as I think it will be more consistent with displaying the actual share/like numbers (a common complaint of the previous Share button).  Also, the default buttons now include ShareThis, which include a couple of great E-mail and Share buttons.  I left the ShareThis Facebook button code as well, in case anyone preferred using that over the new Facebook Like one.</p>

<p>If you have ideas to improve Sharebar or would like to contribute to the code, please leave a comment or send me an e-mail.  I could definitely use some help in debugging the random IE/Thesis theme errors!</p>
