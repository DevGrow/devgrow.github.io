I"š&<p>What can I say, Iâ€™ve been in love with <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/landing_chrome.html?hl=en">Google Chrome</a> since they day it was released.  I resisted using it until extensions were added, as I was highly dependent on my Firefox plugins as a web developer.  As Chrome gets more and more popular, tons of great extensions are being developed that have made it one of the (if not the) best browsers around.</p>

<h2 id="the-top-10">The Top 10</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m always looking for ways to increase productivity and improve my overall experience in the application I spend the most amount of time in: my web browser.  The following are 10 Chrome extensions, when used in conjunction with the <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/4640/what-is-inspect-element-feature-in-google-chrome">Chrome element inspector</a>, that have helped make web developing on Chrome a lot less painful:</p>

</a></p>

<h4 id="1-stayfocusd">1. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji">StayFocusd</a></h4>

<p>This extension is <strong>highly recommended</strong>. StayFocusd is a productivity extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on work by restricting the amount of time you can spend browsing time-wasting websites. Once your allotted time for the day has been used up, the sites you have blocked will be inaccessible for the rest of the day.</p>

  <img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/seo-site-tools.gif" class="image-left" />
</a></p>

<h4 id="3-seo-site-tools">3. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/diahigjngdnkdgajdbpjdeomopbpkjjc">SEO Site Tools</a></h4>

<p>SEO Site Tools provides extensive information on the SEO and ranking of the site.  It includes on-page/external metrics, social media info, Google PageRank and various other rankings for Yahoo, Bing and Alexa.  The tool also checks the page content for validation, proper title tags (for better SEO rankings) and even provides suggestions for improving the overall site ranking.  After trying this extension out for the past couple of days, I have to say I highly recommend it for any site! (thanks to Ileane for suggesting it)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> SEO Site Tools has replaced <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oangcciaeihlfmhppegpdceadpfaoclj">ChromeSEO</a> here, as I feel it is a more comprehensive extension for all things SEO.</p>

<p>CSS Reloader is an extension that allows you to reload all the CSS of any site without you have to reload the page itself.  To use this extension just press F9, and the loaded stylesheets will reload.  The only drawback to this extension is that it does not support files on your local machine using the file:// protocol (however localhost should work).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Awesome Screenshot has replaced <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg">Screen Capture</a> here, as it provides a great annotation system while providing the same screen capture ability of itâ€™s competitors.</p>

Firebug Lite provides the rich visual representation we are used to see in Firebug when it comes to HTML elements, DOM elements, and Box Model shading. It provides also some cool features like inspecting HTML elemements with your mouse, and live editing CSS properties.  Thanks to Jeff for the suggestion.</p>
