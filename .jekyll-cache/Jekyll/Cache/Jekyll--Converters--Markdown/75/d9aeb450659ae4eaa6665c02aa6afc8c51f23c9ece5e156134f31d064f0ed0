I"÷<p>In last month‚Äôs poll, I asked the question ‚ÄúWhat CMS is best for maintaining a static website?‚Äù  Let‚Äôs take a look at the responses and what they mean (and why I disagree with the majority here).</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>WordPress - 76%</strong></li>
  <li>Custom CMS - 18%</li>
  <li>Drupal - 8%</li>
  <li>FrogCMS - 0%</li>
</ol>

<p>It turns out the vast majority of readers feel that WordPress is best suited for maintaining a static website.  As a web developer with many clients that frequently demand static websites, I actually have to disagree with this notion.  WordPress may be the best CMS for many sites, however it is packed with features and options that you probably don‚Äôt need on a simple, static website.  It‚Äôs simply overkill for simple sites and contains features which may end up confusing your client rather than helping them maintain their site.</p>

<h3 id="always-apply-kiss">Always Apply KISS</h3>

<p>If you‚Äôre one of the few who doesn‚Äôt know what KISS is, it is an acronym for <em>Keep It Simple Stupid</em>, and a reminder that often the simplest idea/product is best.  In terms of CMS features, if your client can live without it, leave it out.  A static website entails a site that isn‚Äôt database intensive and will require occasional editing/updating, however for the most part will remain static.  In terms of CMS, it should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content Editing via Authentication</li>
  <li>Possibly uploading images and rich media</li>
  <li>Minimal (if any) DB interaction</li>
</ul>

<p>WordPress can do all of the above and a lot more, which is the main problem.  The need for plugins to create static/cached content is an added headache you don‚Äôt want your clients to have to deal with.</p>

<h3 id="my-pick-custom-cms">My Pick: Custom CMS</h3>

<p>Like I said, I prefer keeping features to the absolute minimum to avoid overwhelming the client and making the entire updating process effortless from their site.  Often you‚Äôll get clients who are not tech-savvy and will require an intense level of coaching, using a more feature-rich CMS in those circumstances will only result in endless support requests and late night phone calls.</p>

<p>For the minimal features listed above, it‚Äôs often easier to just code a simple, custom CMS in PHP and throw it on a shared server.  To avoid DB interactions, use <a href="http://devgrow.com/simple-cache-class/">caching</a> to generate static files and avoid DB calls altogether for the majority of visitors.  Throw in a customized login screen for your client with their company logo and they‚Äôll be even more pleased.  It may require more work than implementing WordPress at first, however you can always reuse your code after that initial development.  Bonus points if you manage to use SQLite so if your client decides to ever change hosts or upgrade servers, they just have to copy over the 1-folder all of their site files are stored in (no DB migration headaches).</p>

<h3 id="the-other-options">The Other Options</h3>

<p><img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/drupal-frog.jpg" class="image-left" /></p>

<p>Two of the other options were <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://www.madebyfrog.com/">FrogCMS</a>.  Drupal is definitely overkill for any simple, static website.  FrogCMS, on the other hand, is probably a little more complex than a custom CMS you code but is still very bare-bones.  If you haven‚Äôt heard of it, be sure to check out their site and the <a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com/demo/2/28/Frog">administration demo</a>.  It may even be worthwhile to start with FrogCMS and strip down all the excess features you don‚Äôt need to get to your ideal custom CMS.</p>
