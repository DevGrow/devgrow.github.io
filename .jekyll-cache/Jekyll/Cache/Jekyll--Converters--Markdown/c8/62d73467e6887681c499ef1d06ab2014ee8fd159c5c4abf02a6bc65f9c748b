I"“<p>Iâ€™ve been running across several new UI PSD kits that cover a wide range of elements, everything from buttons to media players.  I wanted to take a shot at making my own with a few simple elements - feel free to use the following UI elements in any project youâ€™d like.</p>

<div class="download">
  <a href="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/files/ui-pack.zip" class="button primary">Download</a>
  <a href="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ui-pack-preview.png" class="button secondary">Preview</a>
</div>

<p><a href="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ui-pack-preview.png"><img src="http://devgrow.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ui-pack-big.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Even if you donâ€™t end up using the elements themselves, consider taking a look at the blending effects to see how they were achieved.  Iâ€™ll be using this kit and others like it to help create Photoshop mockups for clients more quickly, it saves time not having to remake elements over and over again (obvious I know, not sure why I didnâ€™t consider it earlier).</p>

<p>As always, please leave feedback in the comments and let me know if you like the set!</p>
