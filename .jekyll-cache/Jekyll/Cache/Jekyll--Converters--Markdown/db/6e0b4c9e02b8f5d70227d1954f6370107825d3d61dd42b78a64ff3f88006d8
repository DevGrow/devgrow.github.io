<p>Itâ€™s been a busy month here and I just wanted to take a minute to make a few announcements regarding DevGrow.</p>

<h3 id="monthly-polls">Monthly Polls</h3>

<p>If you notice in the sidebar column, youâ€™ll notice a new section entitled â€˜Monthly Poll.â€™  Every month, weâ€™ll have a new question relevant to web design and development.  At the end of the month, Iâ€™ll write a post covering the results of the poll and any discussion about it in the <a href="http://devgrow.com/discuss">forums</a>.  If you have a suggestion for a poll, <a href="http://devgrow.com/discuss/topic/poll-suggestions">reply to this thread</a> with your ideas.</p>

<h3 id="new-sponsor-linodecom">New Sponsor: <a href="http://devgrow.com/go/linode.com">Linode.com</a></h3>

<p>An exciting announcement this month is that weâ€™ve been fortunate enough to have <a href="http://devgrow.com/go/linode.com">Linode.com</a> sponsor the hosting for this blog!  I switched to Linode nearly 2 years ago and havenâ€™t looked back since - they are the absolute best VPS providers in the game right now.  While they are not the cheapest VPS out there (still cheaper than Slicehost), they have incredible service and a solid backend infrastructure to make server administration easier.  Also, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve had any host-related downtime since switching to them (any downtime has been my own fault).  If youâ€™re in the VPS market, I highly recommend you take a look at their services.</p>

<h3 id="giveaways">Giveaways</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve been planning a few giveaways for DevGrow, mainly for web development and programming books.  If there is anything youâ€™d like to see in particular (book or otherwise), leave a comment and I will see if itâ€™s possible to have that as a giveaway.</p>

<h3 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m still looking for guest authors and contributors - if you are interested in writing an article for DevGrow and getting your 5-minutes of fame (plus traffic), do <a href="http://devgrow.com/contribute">get in touch</a>.  I will be working on an improved layout for the main homepage soon that puts more emphasis on the <a href="http://devgrow.com/discuss/">Discussion Forum</a> and the <a href="http://devgrow.com/gallery/">Inspiration Gallery</a>, two features of the site that are not getting as much usage as Iâ€™d like.</p>

<p>Also, my posting schedule has been slow lately and will continue to be so until the end of October, as have been (and will be) traveling a bit due to work.  I should be back to my regular schedule in November.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback about the site, please leave them in the comments.  Stay tuned for more updates and a new post coming up in the next couple of days!</p>
