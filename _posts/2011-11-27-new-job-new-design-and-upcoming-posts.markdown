**And we're back!**  First off, apologies for the dry spell in new blog posts over the past 3 months - I've been incredibly busy with a new job, moving to the Bay area, family/personal issues and a buildup of client work (all at once!).  Thankfully things have settled down quite a bit and I should have some time each week to dedicate to DevGrow and my other pet projects.

### New Job

I've started a new job as a front-end engineer and designer for a startup in the Bay area.  It's a small startup with big ambitions, and I'll be updating you guys on the lessons I learn while working here from time to time.

### New Design

The new design is aimed at being as minimal as possible.  Gone are the plethora of share buttons, excessive images and unnecessary features - all that remains are the tools needed to read the blog and navigate the archives.  I'm also trying a left-aligned design, however if I find it uncomfortable I'll likely center it within a few weeks (or days?).

### Upcoming Posts

I wanted to start a new chapter of DevGrow, one that focuses more on my personal experiences and the knowledge I gain from the various projects I work on.  This means less 'Top xyz Programs to Build Traffic' and posts aimed at beginners, instead I want to focus more on the technical and analytical side of things.  Hopefully this will do two things: a) make it easier to come up with topics to write about and b) create an archive of useful thoughts for future reference.
